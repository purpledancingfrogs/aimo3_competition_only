submission.parquet is generated INSIDE the Kaggle runtime at:
  /kaggle/working/submission.parquet

Due to Kaggle sandboxing, this file cannot be accessed or copied locally.
Audit authority is the notebook code that writes the parquet via:
  submission.to_parquet('/kaggle/working/submission.parquet', index=False)
