META-SOLVER OBJECTIVE
Reach =45/50 reliably, then extend to 50/50.

ARCHITECTURE
1) Router-first design: classify before solving.
2) Multiple weak solvers > one strong solver.
3) Invariant extraction before computation.
4) Reject malformed problems early (return None).

CURRENT MODULES
- arithmetic_solver: exact Fractions, no floats.
- algebra_solver: single-variable linear/quadratic.
- geometry_solver: placeholder (must be expanded).
- sanity_checks: normalize + guardrails.
- meta_solver: orchestration only.

NEXT UPGRADE PRIORITIES
1) Geometry:
   - Similar triangles
   - Area ratios
   - Pythagorean detection
   - Circle radius/diameter relations

2) Algebra:
   - Multiple '=' handling
   - Word-problem normalization
   - Fractional coefficients

3) Router:
   - Regex-based intent scoring
   - Try top-2 solvers, reconcile answers
   - Fallback heuristic solver

4) Confidence Voting:
   - Solve via =2 paths
   - Accept answer only if consistent

RULES
- No brute force
- No guessing
- No silent failures

SUCCESS CONDITION
Internal validation =90% before any submission.
