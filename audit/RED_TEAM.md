RED TEAM SUMMARY

Identified failure modes:
- Parity/divisibility hallucinations
- Multi-solution ambiguity
- Geometry line vs segment traps
- Semantic misinterpretation
- Boundary ghosts

Mitigations:
- Universal Modulo Guards (UMG)
- Multi-Invariant Closure (MIC)
- Bounded Brute Verification (BBV)
- Solution Uniqueness Certificate (SUC)
- Dual-World Consistency Lock (DWCL)
- Canonical Answer Form (CAF)

No known adversarial construction bypasses all layers.
