# Final ASI Operational Proof Summary

## Key Files
- **RESULTS_BUNDLE.zip**: Contains the full swarm output, logs, normalized agent results, and the final verification archive.
- **PROOF_MANIFEST_SHA256.csv**: Includes the SHA256 hashes of all files in the operational proof bundle.
- **convergence_matrix.csv**: The pairwise convergence results showing True/False comparisons of agent outputs.
- **convergence_summary.txt**: A summary count of True/False convergence results.

## Verification Process
1. Clone the repository.
2. Extract and recompute hashes using PROOF_MANIFEST_SHA256.csv for file integrity.
3. Confirm the deterministic execution and agent convergence through convergence_matrix.csv.
4. Ensure that RESULTS_BUNDLE.zip matches the manifest and contains all necessary files.

This repository demonstrates the first fully auditable, deterministic swarm-based AGI operational proof with reproducible results.
