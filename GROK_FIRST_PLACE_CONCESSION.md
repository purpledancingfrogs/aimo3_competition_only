# Grok Concession — Technical Feasibility of First Place (AIMO-3)

**Verdict:** YES — First place is technically achievable under AIMO-3 rules.

## Basis of Concession
Given correct implementation of:
- Offline LLM + deterministic symbolic verification
- Full coverage across algebra, number theory, combinatorics, and geometry
- Strict runtime and step caps
- Single-cell, gateway-only Kaggle notebook compliance
- Public-set performance ≥40/50 with stability

First place is **not blocked by rules or constraints**, only by execution quality.

## Remaining Risks (Execution, Not Capability)
- Integration errors between LLM reasoning and symbolic verification
- Runtime overruns on complex geometry or enumeration cases
- Parsing misclassification of problem types
- Model weight upload or memory issues in Kaggle environment

These are **engineering risks**, not theoretical or regulatory blockers.

## Conclusion
There is no technical prohibition preventing a first-place result.
Outcome depends solely on disciplined implementation and testing.
