AIMO Progress Prize 3 – Reference Problems and Solutions∗
November 2025
Overview
This document contains a collection of10 reference problems, the “AIMO3 Reference Bench”, each
accompanied by a detailed solution. These correspond to the problems provided inreference.csv
on Kaggle. The purpose of this set is threefold:
1. To verify that your Kaggle notebook works correctly before submitting it to run on the public1
problem set.
2. To familiarise you with the style and format of AIMO3 problems, including answer extraction
conventions (note the move from 3 to 5 digits in the final answer) and the types of intermediate
calculations that may be required.
3. To provide a compact benchmark for preliminary testing of models. (Because of its small size,
this set is obviously not suitable for model training or fine-tuning.)
Before publication, we evaluated these problems using leading models available via API and ollama.
Since these problems had never been exposed to any model before testing, the results represent
uncontaminated performance. The results are shown on the next page.
About the Problems
With the exception ofProblem 10, which adapts an existing problem, all problems in this reference
set are entirely original and have not been publicly released before the launch of AIMO3.
Problems 1–4are drawn from the AIMO2 benchmark. Each includes a brief remark summarising
observed results from the AIMO2 Kaggle competition, and for Problems 2 and 3, references to the
OpenAIevaluationonthepublicAIMO2set(OpenAIxAIMOeval: Thegapisshrinking). Problems
3 and 4 are taken from the private AIMO2 set which was not part of the OpenAI evaluation. The six-
letter problem identifiers (eg “SWEETS”) correspond to those used in the linked analysis. Problem
1 is deliberately straightforward—it is mainly intended as a quick check and should be solvable by
any competent model.
Problems 5–9 are challenging, novel problems designed to reflect the style and difficulty of the
upcoming AIMO3 dataset. Their difficulty is intentionally higher than that of AIMO2 to ensure the
problems continue to challenge the strongest current open-source models.
Problem 10is an adaptation of a problem from the International Mathematical Olympiad (IMO)
Shortlist. It illustrates the process of converting a traditional olympiad-style question into the
answer-only format used in AIMO. All problems in the AIMO public and private sets are fully
original; we chose to adapt this one to preserve the hardest original material for the competition
datasets.
About the Solutions
Solutions are written for clarity rather than brevity. Where a result depends on a standard the-
orem or lemma, a brief reference is provided when possible. The goal is to make each argument
straightforward to follow, while acknowledging that the problems themselves are challenging. Only
one solution path is shown for each problem, though multiple valid approaches may exist.
∗To cite these problems, please refer to the citation of the associated Kaggle competition.
1Public is somewhat of a misnomer here as the problem set isnot publicly available. Instead, ‘public’ refers to
the problems being used for the public leaderboard on Kaggle.

Model Evaluation Results
We evaluated 14 leading language models on the 10-problem AIMO3 Reference Bench, including
both commercial APIs and open-weight models. The results reveal a significant performance gap
that AIMO3 aims to close.2
The strongest commercial models—GPT-5 Pro and GPT-5.1 (high)—solved all 10 problems, with
GPT-5 (high), Grok-4, andGemini 2.5 Pro each solving 9 out of 10 (failing only on the hardest
Problem 10). In contrast, most open-weight models struggled beyond the easier AIMO2 problems
(Problems 1–4). The best-performing non-DeepSeek open-weight model,gpt-oss-120b, solved only
these four problems and none of the harder Problems 5–10.
A notable exception isDeepSeek-v3.1-terminus (thinking), which matched the performance of
second-tier commercial models by solving 9 out of 10 problems. However, this is a substantially
larger model (671B parameters) compared to other open-weight entries, and still falls short of the
top commercial systems on the hardest problem.
Creating problems that challenge frontier models while working within AIMO’s format presents
a significant design challenge. The competition requires IMO-style problems with non-guessable
integer answers for automated evaluation. Most olympiad problems, however, are proof-based and
either have no numerical answer at all, or have answers that are easily guessable (eg, small integers)
or binary (yes/no). While challenging problems meeting AIMO’s criteria do exist, they are much
harder to identify and create. Proof-based evaluation would open up significantly more options for
difficult olympiad problems, but remains challenging to implement in a scalable and reliable way.
The near-perfect performance of frontier commercial models on this reference set demonstrates
what’s possible: closing this gap across the full 50-problem public set could yield scores in the high
40s. This would represent a substantial leap from the mid-30s winning scores in AIMO1 and AIMO2,
marking a major milestone in open-source mathematical reasoning capabilities.
Closing this gap is the core challenge of AIMO3. Can your submission demonstrate that open-weight
models can match frontier commercial performance on advanced mathematical reasoning?
2Model outputs are non-deterministic, so results may vary across runs. Additionally, models accessed via API
may be updated over time, potentially affecting performance.

Problem 1
Problem: Alice and Bob are each holding some integer number of sweets. Alice says to Bob: “If
we each added the number of sweets we’re holding to our (positive integer) age, my answer would
be double yours. If we took the product, then my answer would be four times yours.” Bob replies:
“Why don’t you give me five of your sweets because then both our sum and product would be equal.”
What is the product of Alice and Bob’s ages?
Answer: 50
Solution: Let Alice and Bob’s ages bexA and xB, respectively. After Alice gives Bob five sweets,
let Alice haveyA sweets and Bob haveyB sweets. We have
(
S = xA + yA = xB + yB
P = xAyA = xByB
.
Theunorderedpairs {xA, yA} and{xB, yB} eachformthesetofrootsofthequadratic z2−Sz+P = 0.
Hence the sets are equal (possibly with the elements swapped). We consider the two cases.
Case 1xA = xB = x, yA = yB = y
Before the exchange, Alice holdsy + 5 sweets and Boby − 5 so the conditions become
(
(x + y + 5) = 2(x + y − 5) =⇒ x + y = 15
x(y + 5) = 4x(y − 5) =⇒ x(3y − 25) = 0 .
The second condition forces eitherx = 0 or 3y = 25, both of which violate the ages being positive
integers.
Case 2xA = yB = x, yA = xB = y
Before the exchange, Alice holdsy + 5 sweets and Bobx − 5 so the conditions become:
(
(x + y + 5) = 2(x + y − 5) =⇒ x + y = 15
x(y + 5) = 4y(x − 5) =⇒ 3xy − 20y − 5x = 0
=⇒ 0 = 3x(15 − x) − 20(15 − x) − 5x = −3(x − 10)2 =⇒ x = 10.
We then havey = 15 − x = 5. It is easy to verify that if at the start, Alice is aged 10 and holds 10
sweets and Bob is aged 5 and holds 5 sweets then the conditions are satisfied. Therefore, the answer
we report is5 × 10 = 50 .
Remark: This problem was part of the AIMO2 private set (“SWEETS”) and was solved by approx-
imately 85% of submissions, including all of the top 100. We include it as an example of a problem
that current models are expected to solve easily, which may assist in testing your model using the
reference set on Kaggle. This problem is easier than any problem used in AIMO3, so the problems
below should be used instead to give an indication of difficulty.

Problem 2
Problem: A 500 × 500 square is divided intok rectangles, each having integer side lengths. Given
that no two of these rectangles have the same perimeter, the largest possible value ofk is K. What
is the remainder whenK is divided by105?
Answer: 520
Solution: Wefirstshowthatthesquarecanbedividedinto 520 rectanglessubjecttotheconstraints,
and then prove that this is the maximum number possible.
In the bottom 249 rows, place 249 pairs of rectangles 1 × i and 1 × (500 − i) for i = 1, . . . ,249.
Then, place a single1 × 500 rectangle in the row above to complete the bottom half. For the top
half, place a1 × 250 rectangle vertically along the left side and then20 more horizontal rectangles
i × 499 for i = 3, 4, . . . ,22 (note that3 + 4 +··· + 22 = 1
2 · 22 · 23 − 3 = 250).
The rectangles in the bottom half have perimeters4, 6, . . . ,500, 504, 506, . . . ,1000, 1002 whilst the
rectangles in the top half have perimeters502, 1004, 1006, . . . ,1042 so all these perimeters are dif-
ferent. In total we have placed(2 × 249) + 1 + 1 + 20 = 520rectangles proving the lower bound.
To show that520 is optimal, assume we can placek ≥ 521 rectangles subject to the constraint.
First, note that the perimeters are all even integers and equal to2s where s is the semi-perimeter of
the rectangle. Ifthe two sides of the rectangle arex andy, thens = x+y and the area of the rectangle
is A = xy = x(s − x). Since this is a downwards-pointing quadratic inx, A is minimised whenx
takes either its minimum or maximum value. Noting that1 ≤ x ≤ 500 and 1 ≤ y = s − x ≤ 500, we
see
max {1, s− 500} ≤x ≤ min {500, s− 1}.
If s ≤ 500, this bound is simply1 ≤ x ≤ s − 1 and we see both the minimum and maximum values
for x give A = s − 1 meaning thatA ≥ s − 1 whenever s ≤ 500.
If s ≥ 501, the bound becomess − 500 ≤ x ≤ 500 and we see both the minimum and maximum
values forx give A = 500(s − 500) meaning thatA ≥ 500(s − 500) whenever s ≥ 501.
Define
f(s) =
(
s − 1 1 ≤ s ≤ 500
500(s − 500) s ≥ 501 .
Observing that500 −1 = 499 < 500(501 −500), we see thatf(s) is an increasing function. Further-
more, the above shows a rectangle with semi-perimeters has areaA ≥ f(s).
Now suppose the 521 rectangles have semi-perimeters 2 ≤ s1 < s2 < ··· < s521 and areas
A1, . . . , A521. By considering the total area of the rectangles and using that f(s) is increasing,
we have
5002 = A1 + ··· + A521 ≥ f(s1) + ··· + f(s521) ≥ f(2) + f(3) + ··· + f(522).
We can then calculate
5002 ≥
500X
s=2
f(s) +
522X
s=501
f(s) =
500X
s=2
(s − 1) +
522X
s=501
500(s − 500) = 124,750 + 126,500 > 5002
which is a contradiction.
Thus, 520 is indeed the optimal number of rectangles and this is the answer we report.

Remark 1:As this problem demonstrates, some answers are already smaller than the modulus for
which the remainder is requested. In this case, the model should simply return the answer with no
further calculations required.
Remark 2: This problem was part of the AIMO2 public set (“RECTIL”) and was solved by only
a handful of the top 100 teams, and by none of the ultimate top 5. Interestingly, in the OpenAI
x AIMO eval, the high compute run did not return the correct answer in its top response though
lower compute runs did return the correct answer.

Problem 3
Problem: Let ABC be an acute-angled triangle with integer side lengths andAB < AC. Points
D and E lie on segmentsBC and AC, respectively, such thatAD = AE = AB. LineDE intersects
AB at X. Circles BXD and CED intersect for the second time atY ̸= D. Suppose that Y lies
on lineAD. There is a unique such triangle with minimal perimeter. This triangle has side lengths
a = BC, b = CA, andc = AB. Find the remainder whenabc is divided by105.
Answer: 336
Solution: As Y lies on lineAD, we seeA lies on lineDY which is the radical axis of circlesBXD
and CED . We therefore haveAE · AC = AB · AX, which givesAX = AC since AE = AB. These
two results together show pairs(B, E) and (X, C) are reflections across the bisector of∠BAC so D
must be the intersection of this bisector withBC. We can run this argument in reverse to see that
D lying on the angle bisector is also a sufficient condition forY to lie on lineAD.

If we defineD′ as the intersection of the internal angle bisector of∠BAC with sideBC, the above
shows thatY lies onAD if and only ifAD′ = AB (and thereforeD = D′).
From angle bisector theorem, we haveBD′ = ac
b+c and CD′ = ab
b+c . Define d = AD′. We can apply
Stewart’s theorem to triangleABC with cevianAD to get
a · ac
b + c · ab
b + c + ad2 = b2 · ac
b + c + c2 · ab
b + c = abc =⇒ d2 = bc

We are told thata, b, care positive integers withc < b. We want to find the minimum such values
that are the sides of a triangle and satisfy these conditions.

These will always be satisfied for coprime positive integersx and y with x > y. We can also check
b > c⇐⇒ x2 > x
 
x2 − y2
⇐⇒ xy2 > 0
which will be satisfied forx, y≥ 1.
Lastly, note that all the steps above are reversible so the family given in (■) exactly characterises
triangles with the desired property.
What remains is to find the triangle with minimal perimeter. Sincek simply scales the perimeter,
we must havek = 1 for the triangle with minimal perimeter and then

This is an increasing function ofx so to minimise the perimeter, we will choosex = y + 1 (which
means x and y will be coprime). The above becomes
··· = (2y + 1)

y2 + 4y + 2

which is an increasing function ofy so is minimised aty = 1.
The pairx = 2, y = 1 corresponds to(a, b, c) = (7, 8, 6) which has all of the required properties (the
triangle is acute since82 < 72 + 62). The answer we report is
7 × 8 × 6 = 336 .
Remark: This problem was also part of the AIMO2 public set (“MINPER”) and was again solved
by only a handful of the top 100 teams, and by none of the ultimate top 5. This problem was solved
in the OpenAI x AIMO eval by all compute levels.

Problem 4
Problem: Let f : Z≥1 → Z≥1 be a function such that for all positive integersm and n,
f(m) + f(n) = f(m + n + mn).
Across all functionsf such thatf(n) ≤ 1000 for alln ≤ 1000, how many different values canf(2024)
take?
Answer: 580
Solution: Let Z≥2 = {2, 3, . . .} be the set of positive integers greater than or equal to2. Define a
function g : Z≥2 → Z≥1 by g(n) = f(n − 1) for n ≥ 2. From the given relation forf we have, for
n, m≥ 2,
g(m) +g(n) = f(m −1) +f(n −1) = f(m −1 +n −1 + (m −1)(n −1)) = f(mn −1) = g(mn). (∗)
Repeatedly applying (∗), we see that ifn = pα1
1 ··· pαk
k is the prime factorisation ofn ≥ 2 then
g(n) = g(pα1
1 ) + ··· + g(pαk
k ) = α1 · g(p1) + ··· + αk · g(pk). (▲)
We havef(2024) = g(2025) and the prime factorisation of2025 is 2025 = 34 · 52 so
f(2024) = g(2025) = 4g(3) + 2g(5).
We are left to consider the possible values for the above quantity subject to the condition that
g(n) = f(n − 1) ≤ 1000 for 2 ≤ n ≤ 1001.
Claim: 1 ≤ g(3) ≤ 166 and 1 ≤ g(5) ≤ 250. For each choice ofg(3) and g(5) in these ranges, we
can construct a functiong satisfying (∗).
Proof. Firstly, from (▲), we have
1000 ≥ g(729) = g

 
54
= 4g(5) =⇒ g(5) ≤
1000
4

= 250
which proves the bounds.
Next, let1 ≤ s ≤ 166 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 250. For a positive integern ≥ 2, letn = 3α · 5β · pγ1
1 ··· pγk
k be
its prime factorisation withpi ̸= 3, 5 and possibly withα or β being 0. Define a functiong by
g(n) = g
 
3α · 5β · pγ1
1 ··· pγk
k

= αs + βt + γ1 + ··· + γk.
This can easily be seen to satisfy (∗) and also hasg(3) = s, g(5) = t.
Let n ≤ 1001, it remains to checkg(n) ≤ 1000. Define γ = γ1 + ··· + γk then
1001 ≥ n ≥ 2γ · 3α · 5β and g(n) = αs + βt + γ ≤ 166α + 250β + γ. (■)
We now consider the possible values forβ. Since 5β ≤ n ≤ 1001, we have0 ≤ β ≤ 4.
• β = 4: Since 54 = 625, (■) forcesα = γ = 0 so g(n) ≤ 250 × 4 = 1000.
8

===== PAGE 9/28 =====
• β = 3: Similarly,53 = 125 so from (■), α ≤ 1 and γ ≤ 3 so
g(n) ≤ 166 × 1 + 250× 3 + 3 = 919 ≤ 1000.
• β = 2: If α = 3, then1001 ≥ n = 2γ · 33 · 52 = 675 · 2γ so γ = 0. From (■),
g(n) ≤ 3 × 166 + 2× 250 + 0 = 998 ≤ 1000.
Otherwise, α ≤ 2 and, asγ ≤ 5,
g(n) ≤ 166 × 2 + 250× 2 + 5 = 837 ≤ 1000.
• β = 1: 51 = 5 and from (■), α ≤ 4, γ ≤ 7 so
g(n) ≤ 166 × 4 + 250× 1 + 7 = 921 ≤ 1000.
• β = 0: If α = 6, then γ = 0 and g(n) ≤ 6 × 166 = 996 ≤ 1000. Otherwise, α ≤ 5 and also
γ ≤ 9 leading to
g(n) ≤ 166 × 5 + 250× 0 + 9 = 839 ≤ 1000.
In any case, we see the condition ong will be satisfied so we can reverse the process to get a valid
function f.
From the Claim, we havef(2024) = 4s + 2t = 2(2s + t) with 1 ≤ s ≤ 166 and 1 ≤ t ≤ 250. (2s + t)
can take any value between3 and 250 + 2 × 166 = 582 and f(2024) is equal to double this so, in
total, there are582 − 3 + 1 = 580 possible values which is the answer we report.
Remark: This problem was part of the AIMO2 private set (“FUNVAL”) and was solved by about
2% of all submissions, including roughly 20% of the top 100 (though not all of the top 5). This
highlights the trade-offs made by top-ranking models, which may fail to solve certain problems that
a larger fraction of lower-ranked models can, yet they still achieve higher overall performance.

Problem 5
Problem: A tournament is held with220 runners each of which has a different running speed. In
each race, two runners compete against each other with the faster runner always winning the race.
The competition consists of20 rounds with each runner starting with a score of0. In each round,
the runners are paired in such a way that in each pair, both runners have the same score at the
beginning of the round. The winner of each race in theith round receives220−i points and the loser
gets no points.
At the end of the tournament, we rank the competitors according to their scores. LetN denote the
number of possible orderings of the competitors at the end of the tournament. Letk be the largest
positive integer such that10k divides N. What is the remainder whenk is divided by105?
Answer: 21818
Solution: Since the points received in a given round are strictly greater than the points available
in all subsequent rounds (from2k > 2k − 1 = 2k−1 + 2k−2 + ··· + 1), each runner must be paired
with another runner with an identical win/loss record in the preceding rounds (so they have the
same score). Thus, in roundi there are2i−1 groups (based on the possible win/loss sequences in the
previous i − 1 rounds) each consisting of221−i runners. Also, a runner’s (ordered) win/loss record
across the rounds uniquely determines their final position by uniqueness of binary expansions.
Consider a group with the same score in a particular round and let there be2n runners in that group.
We need to count the number of valid ways to choosen winners from these2n runners. Label the
runners from1 (fastest) to2n (slowest), and record the outcome of each race in a left-to-right string
of parentheses, where:
• ( indicates that runner wins the race,
• ) indicates that runner loses.
In a valid string, each( must match with a later), corresponding to a race between a faster and
slower runner. For example, whenn = 3, the string(()()) represents the matches:1 beats 6, 2 beats
3, and4 beats 5.
It is well-known that the number of such valid parenthesis strings is thenth Catalan number

n!(n + 1)!.

ways to choose the winners in this round. Since each choice of winners across the different groups
will lead to a different final position (by the comment at the top about the win/loss records uniquely
determining the final position), the number of possible orderings is equal to the product of the above

Since powers of2 cycle with period4 modulo 5, we have that220−i + 1 will be divisible by5 if and
only if20 − i ≡ 2 mod 4 which is equivalent toi = 4k + 2 for some non-negative integerk. In this
case, we can write
220−i + 1 = 220−(4k+2) + 1 = 22(9−2k) + 1 = 49−2k + 1.
We can apply the Lifting the Exponent Lemma (or just directly compute given the small number of
possibilities fork) that

= 22−1 + 26−1 + 210−1 · 2 + 214−1 + 218−1 = 140,322 .
Thus,
ν5(N) = 262,140 − 140,322 = 121,818 .
To get a factor of10 in N, we must have a factor of2 and a factor of5. Noting that 219 − 1 =
524,287 > 121,818, we see that factors of5 are the limiting ones. We therefore have
k = ν5(N) = 121,818 ≡ 21818 (mod 105)
which is the answer we report.

. Let k be the largest non-negative

Answer: 32951
Solution: We make use of two identities. Defineσk(n) = P
d|n
dk.
Claim 1:(Hermite’s Identity). For anyx ∈ R and positive integern, we have

Proof. Let

Then,

hence d is periodic with period1
n . Since all floors are 0 forx ∈

n

, this givesd ≡ 0 in general.
Claim 2:For any positive integern,
nX
j=1
σk(j) =
nX
d=1
dk

Proof. We count
S =

in two ways. TheLHS of (■) comes from the definition ofσk.
For d = 1, 2, . . . , n, we have

d

multiples ofd at mostn, hence this is the number of timesdk is
summed. This gives theRHS of (■). Thus, both sides of (■) are equal toS so in particular, are
equal to each other.
Flipping the order of summation inf, we have

p1024 − 1 .
We want to count the number of factors of2 in this expression. Forp = 2, the expression will be
odd so it suffices to consider the oddp. We apply the Lifting the Exponent Lemma in the even
power case to get

+ ν2(16) − 1 = 1 + 4− 1 = 4.
where we have usedp2 ≡ 1 mod 4 for all oddp so p1024 + 1 ≡ 2 mod 4 is divisible by2 but not4.
Since there are5 odd elements ofP, we get
k = ν2(N) = 5 · 4 = 20.
Lastly, we compute
2k = 220 ≡ 32951 (mod 57)
which is the answer we report.
Remark: The choice of57 as the modulus in this problem is intended to emphasise that models
should be able to handle a variety of moduli—not just105 or 99991 which are the most commonly
used (the latter is used when a prime modulus is desirable). For AIMO3, all problem statements
have the modulus included explicitly (unlike for AIMO1 and AIMO2 where there was an implicit
step of taking your answer modulo 1000).

Problem: Let ABC be a triangle withAB ̸= AC, circumcircleΩ, and incircleω. Let the contact
points ofω with BC, CA, andAB be D, E, andF, respectively. Let the circumcircle ofAF Emeet

Answer: 57447

the n-tastic condition later.

Fromitsdefinition, K isthecentreofspiralsimilaritytaking F E→ BC. Denotethisspiralsimilarity
by f so f(F) = B, f(E) = C, andf(K) = K. We recall some well-known results:
• K is also the centre of spiral similarity takingBF → CE.
• T′BF Kis cyclic—denote this circle byΓ.
Claim 1:f(N) = D.
Proof. This is a well-known result but for completeness, we provide a proof.
Firstly, recall that linesAD, BE, and CF concur at the Gergonne point of triangleABC. Thus,
we can apply Ceva’s and Menelaus’s theorem to get
BT ′
T′C
Menelaus
= −AE
EC · BF
F A
Ceva
= −BD
DC
where we are using directed lengths so if a point lies outside the segment, the ratio is negative. This
means that(B, C; T′, D) = −1 where the term in brackets denotes the cross ratio of the four points.
We have∠T′ND = 90◦ and it is well-known (eg see here) that these two properties combined imply
that ND and T′N bisect ∠BNC (internally and externally, respectively).
From this, we get∠F NB= ∠CNE . Since AE = AF, ∠AEF = ∠EFA which implies∠BF N=
∠NEC . Combining these two results shows triangleBF Nand CEN are similar hence
F N
NE = BF
CE = BD
DC
where we have used thatBF and BD are both tangents fromB to the incircle so have equal length,
and similarly forC.
Since f(F E) = BC and N and D split these segments in the same ratio, the claim follows.
A consequence of Claim 1 and properties of spiral similarities is thatΣ passes through T′. Since
∠T′ND = 90◦, this also showsΣ has diameterT′D.
Claim 2:P lies onΓ.
Proof. Firstly, note thatσ is uniquely defined as the circle passing throughK and N that has centre
on lineEF (which is equivalent toσ passing throughK′). Applying the transformationf, we see
f(σ) is uniquely defined as the circle passing throughf(K) = K and f(N) = D (Claim 1) that has
centre on linef(EF ) = BC. But from the comment above, this precisely definesΣ, thusf(σ) = Σ.
Next, we see that
∠F NP= ∠T′NP ′ = ∠T′DP ′ = ∠BDP ′.
Since f(F N) = BD and f(σ) = Σ, this showsf(P) = P′. Thus,
∠F P K= ∠f(F)f(P)f(K) = ∠BP ′K = ∠NP ′K = ∠NT ′K = ∠F T′K
which shows thatP lies on circleF T′K ie Γ.
15

===== PAGE 16/28 =====
Claim 3:For ann-tastic triangle,T = T′ and BNEC is cyclic.
Proof. For these trianglesB lies onσ so we must in fact haveP = B. It then follows (by considering
P moving towardsB along line BN ) that Γ is tangent toBN at B. Since Γ also passes through
K, this must be the circle described at the bottom of the first paragraph in the question. SinceΓ
intersects BC again atT′ ̸= B, the first part of the claim follows.
For the second part, applying the alternate segment theorem using the tangency ofΓ to BN we get
∠CBN = ∠T BP′ = ∠T F B= ∠EF A= ∠AEF = 180◦ − ∠NEC
which proves thatBNEC is cyclic.
A
B = P CD
E
F
K
K′
N
T = T′
We now considern-tastic triangles and useT and T′ interchangeably since they are the same point.
Recalling from Claim 1 that trianglesBF Nand CEN are similar and then using Claim 3 we get
∠EBN = ∠ECN = ∠NBF = ∠BT N
where in the last step we used thatBN is tangent toΓ. We also have
∠CBE = ∠CNE = ∠F NB= 180◦ − ∠BNE = ∠ECB
so EC = EB.
Applying the sine rule to trianglesEBN and ET B, we get
NB
NE = sin ∠NEB
sin ∠EBN = sin ∠T EB
sin ∠BT E= BT
BE = BT
CE = BT
CD .
We can use this to rewrite the target expression in the question as
CT · NB
BT · NE = CT
BT · BT
CD = CT
CD .
16

===== PAGE 17/28 =====
We are told that BD = Fn and CD = Fn+1 so BC = BD + CD = Fn+2. Returning to the
calculations in Claim 1 (and this time using undirected lengths), we have
CD
BD = Fn+1
Fn
= CT
BT = CT
CT − BC = CT
CT − Fn+2
=⇒ CT = Fn+1Fn+2
Fn−1
.
This allows us to write (noting that the quantity in the question is constant across alln-tastic
triangles)
an = CT · NB
BT · NE = CT
CD = Fn+2
Fn−1
.
Let φ = (1 +
√
5)/2 be the golden ratio. Using Binet’s formula, we can write
an = φn+2 − (−φ)−(n+2)
φn−1 − (−φ)−(n−1) .
Now specialising ton even, we have
a2n = φ2n+2 − φ−(2n+2)
φ2n−1 + φ−(2n−1) = φ3 · 1 − φ−4n−4
1 + φ−4n+2
| {z }
(∗)
< φ3.
Since φ >1, we have(∗) → 1
1 = 1 as n → ∞, thus the smallest real numberα with the desired
property isφ3. We can compute
φ3 = 2 +
√
5 =⇒ p = 2 , q= 5
so the answer we report is
252
= 33554432 ≡ 57447 (mod 99991).
Remark: Because of the problem’s conditional structure—and that it concerns a family of triangles
rather than one specific configuration—brute-force approaches that attempt to construct one or
more diagrams and compute all lengths numerically are unlikely to succeed.

and replaces it with
∞P
k=0
ak.
Across all choices of1 ≤ n ≤ 10105
, the largest possible number of moves Ken could make isM.
What is the remainder whenM is divided by105?
Answer: 32193
Solution: Consider the directed graphG with positive integers as vertices and a directed edge from
n to every output of a move fromn. We completely determineG.
Claim 1:The outgoing neighbours ofn are exactly{⌈n/2⌉, ⌈n/2⌉ −1, . . . ,2, 1}.
Proof. These are achievable by bases ⌊n/2⌋ + 1, ⌊n/2⌋ + 2, . . . , n, respectively since for a base
⌊n/2⌋ + 1 ≤ b ≤ n, n has two digits in base-b, 1 and n − b, so the digit sum isn + 1 − b.
Next we show that there are no other neighbours. Equivalently, we need to prove that if there is an
edge fromn to r (that is, if for some baseb with 2 ≤ b ≤ n the sum of the base-b digits ofn equals
r), thenr ≤ ⌈n/2⌉. We can verify this directly forn ≤ 10, so henceforth assumen >10.
Consider n in base-b, where2 ≤ b < n. Since we wish to maximise the sum of the base-b digits, we
can replacebk with b copies ofbk−1 as this will always increase the sum of the digits. Repeating this
process for all powersbk for k ≥ 2, we reducen to having only2 base-b digits, the largest of which
must be⌊n/b⌋ so we can write
n =
jn
b
k
b +

n − b
jn

k
.
Thus, in general
r = Sum of base-b digits ofn ≤
jn
b
k
+

n − b
jn
b
k
=
jn
b
k
+ (n mod b)
where the final term should take the remainder in the range0 to b − 1.
Forb = 2, this gives⌈n/2⌉.
For3 ≤ b ≤ ⌊n/2⌋ −2, we have the bound
r ≤
jn
b
k
+ (n mod b) ≤ n
b + b − 1.
For fixedn, considerf(b) = (n/b) + b. Since
f(b + 1) − f(b) = − n
b(b + 1) + 1,
18

===== PAGE 19/28 =====
f will be decreasing up to a certain value (possibly no values) and then will be increasing from that
point on. This meansf(b) will be maximised at an endpoint. By rearranging, we have
f(3) = (n/3) + 3 ≤ ⌈n/2⌉ + 1 ⇐⇒
(
n ≥ 12 n even
n ≥ 9 n odd
which are both true sincen >10.
Forb = ⌊n/2⌋ −2, we have
f(⌊n/2⌋ −2) = n
⌊n/2⌋ −2 + ⌊n/2⌋ −2 ≤ ⌈n/2⌉ + 1 ⇐⇒
(
n ≥ 12 n even
n ≥ 10 n odd
which are both true sincen >10. Thus, we have shownf(b) ≤ ⌈n/2⌉ + 1 for b in the given range
meaning
r ≤ f(b) − 1 ≤ ⌈n/2⌉
as desired.
We are left to consider⌊n/2⌋ −1 ≤ b ≤ n.
For⌊n/2⌋ −1 ≤ b ≤ ⌊n/2⌋, n in base-b will have two digits, the first being a2 and the second being
0, 1, 2, or3. Thus the sum of the digits is≤ 5 ≤ ⌈n/2⌉ (since n >10).
For⌊n/2⌋ + 1 ≤ b ≤ n, n in base-b will be two digits, the first of which is1 and the second of which
is n − b. Thus,
r = 1 + (n − b) ≤ n + 1 − (⌊n/2⌋ + 1) = n − ⌊n/2⌋ = ⌈n/2⌉
since b ≥ ⌊n/2⌋ + 1. This completes the proof.
Claim 2:The length of the longest path fromn to 1 has length⌈log2(n)⌉.
Proof. Note that a move strictly decreases the value on the blackboard. Letf(n) denote the length
of the longest path fromn to 1 inG. By considering the first move and using Claim 1, we get
f(n) = 1 + max{f(⌈n/2⌉), f(⌈n/2⌉ −1), . . . , f(2), f(1)}.
This Claim then follows by induction, using⌈log2(2n + 1)⌉ = ⌈log2(2n)⌉ = 1 + ⌈log2(n)⌉ for n ≥ 1
since 2n + 1 is not a power of 2.
Thus, we extract the answer

problems for AIMO3 are very large. We expect models to be able to handle calculations such as the
above when calculating answers.

Problem 9
Problem: Let F be the set of functionsα: Z → Z for which there are only finitely manyn ∈ Z
such thatα(n) ̸= 0.
For two functionsα and β in F, define their productα ⋆ βto be P
n∈Z
α(n) · β(n). Also, for n ∈ Z,
define a shift operatorSn : F → Fby Sn(α)(t) = α(t + n) for allt ∈ Z.
A functionα ∈ Fis calledshifty if
• α(m) = 0 for all integersm <0 and m >8 and
• There existsβ ∈ Fand integersk ̸= l such that for alln ∈ Z
Sn(α) ⋆ β=
(
1 n ∈ {k, l}
0 n ̸∈ {k, l} .
How many shifty functions are there inF?
Answer: 160
Solution: Forα ∈ F, we define two functions
Pα(x) =
X
k∈Z
α(k) · xk Qα(x) =
X
k∈Z
α(k) · x−k.
The conditions onF ensure that both sums only have finitely many non-zero terms and soPα is
a polynomial of degree at most8 and Qα is a finite Laurent polynomial (an extension of a normal
polynomial to include negative powers ofx).
Let α ∈ Fbe shifty and letβ be such thatSn(α)⋆β is of the form defined in the question statement.
We have
Sn(α) ⋆ β=
X
k∈Z
Sn(α)(k)β(k) =
X
k∈Z
α(k + n)β(k).
We can write
Pα(x) =
X
k∈Z
α(k + n)xk+n = xn X
k∈Z
α(k + n)xk.
For a Laurent polynomialR and integerp, let[xp] R denote thexp coefficient inR. Using the above,
we can write
Sn(α) ⋆ β= [xn] Pα · Qβ =⇒ xk + xl =
X
n∈Z
Sn(α) ⋆ β= Pα(x)Qβ(x)
where k and l are as in the condition in the problem statement.
Note that multiplyingQ by a power ofx (which is the same as shiftingβ to the right) will just
increase the integers k and l (by the same amount). Thus, we can assume thatQβ is in fact a
polynomial andk and l are non-negative integers.
The question now becomes how many polynomialsP of degree at most8 divide a polynomial of the
form xk + xl for non-negative integers0 ≤ k < l. Settingb = l −k ≥ 1, this is equivalent to dividing
a polynomial of the form
xa  
xb + 1

for non-negative integersa and b.
20

===== PAGE 21/28 =====
LetΦn(x) denote thenth cyclotomic polynomial which has integer coefficients and degreeφ(n) where
φ is the Euler totient function. This is well-known to be irreducible and also we have



d|2b , d∤b

As theΦd are all irreducible, a polynomialP will divide a polynomial of the above form if and only
if it can be written as
P(x) = ±xm Y
d∈S
Φd(x) (■)
for a non-negative integerm and a (possibly empty) setS which has the property that all its elements
have the same largest power of2 dividing them and that power is at least21 (to enable us to choose
a positive integern such thatS ⊂ {d : d|2n, d∤ n}). We will count the number of choices with a+
sign and then double the count at the end to allow for the choices with a− sign. Note thatP is not
identically 0 so these choices of sign will yield different polynomials.
Claim: φ(n) ≤ 8 if and only if1 ≤ n ≤ 10 or
n ∈ {12, 14, 15, 16, 18, 20, 24, 30}.
Proof. It is easy to check all then in the given set giveφ(n) ≤ 8. Now, for contradiction, assume
there is a positive integern not on our list withφ(n) ≤ 8.
If n has at least three odd prime divisorsp1 < p2 < p3 then
φ(n) ≥ (p1 − 1) (p2 − 1) (p3 − 1) ≥ (3 − 1)(5 − 1)(7 − 1) = 48 > 8.
If n has two odd prime divisorsp1 < p2 then ifp2 ≥ 7 we have
φ(n) ≥ (p1 − 1) (p2 − 1) ≥ (3 − 1)(7 − 1) = 12 > 8.
Otherwise, p1 = 3 and p2 = 5 so 15 | n. n ∈ {15, 30} are already on our list son/15 must be divisible
by at least one of3, 4 or 5 which means
φ(n) ≥ 2 · φ(n/15) ≥ 2(3 − 1)(5 − 1) = 16 > 8.
If n has one odd prime divisor, sayp with νp(n) = k for a positive integerk then
φ(n) ≥ φ

pk
= pk−1(p − 1) ≥ 2 · 3k−1.
Fork ≥ 3, this is> 8.
For k = 2, ifp ≥ 5, this is≥ 5 · (5 − 1) > 8 so the only possibility isp = 3. n ∈ {9, 18} are already
on our list son must be divisible by4 as well as9 which means
φ(n) ≥ 2 · φ(9) = 2 · 6 > 8.
21

===== PAGE 22/28 =====
Fork = 1, ifp ≥ 11 then we haveφ(n) ≥ p−1 > 8. Checking the remaining possibilitiesp ∈ {3, 5, 7}
and noting that forφ(n), the largest power of2 dividing n is at most23, 22, and21, respectively,
we recover then already on our list.
The last case isn = 2α and since φ (2α) = 2 α−1, we requireα ≤ 4 for φ(n) ≤ 8 and we get the
remaining n from our list.
We now split into cases based on the largest power of2 dividing elements ofS (which is the same
for all elements of S as noted above). To avoid double-counting across cases, we exclude the9
polynomials corresponding toS empty (P(x) = 1, x, . . . , x8) and add these back in at the end.
Case 1: All elements ofS are divisible by2 but not4
From the Claim above, the only options fors ∈ S such thatφ(s) ≤ 8 are inS1 = {2, 6, 10, 14, 18, 30}.
This is in turn equal to

We can then sum all coefficients of terms of degree≤ 8 to get
9 + 8 + 7 + 6 + 5 + 4 + 3(3 + 2 + 1) = 57.
We must now subtract the9 polynomials that haveS empty giving57 − 9 = 48 possibilities forP
from this case.
Case 2: All elements ofS are divisible by4 but not8
From the Claim above, the only options fors ∈ S such thatφ(s) ≤ 8 are inS2 = {4, 12, 20}. The
degrees ofΦs for s ∈ S2 is 2, 4, and8, respectively. To ensureP has degree at most8, we can choose
S = {4}, {12}, {20}, {4, 12}
which gives (counting the possibilities form of which there are9 minus the sum of the degrees of
Φs since we can havem = 0)
7 + 5 + 1 + 3 = 16
possibilities forP.

===== PAGE 23/28 =====
Case 3: All elements ofS are divisible by8 but not16
From the Claim, we must chooseS ⊂ {8, 24} and we haveφ(8) = 4, φ(24) = 8. S must therefore
be a singleton set and we get5 + 1 = 6 possibilities (counting the possibilities form as above).
Case 4: All elements ofS are divisible by16 but not32
In this case we haveS = {16} giving a single possibility forP since φ(16) = 8 so m = 0.
Combining the four cases and adding in the9 possibilities forP where S is empty, we get
48 + 16 + 6 + 1 + 9 = 80
possibilities for P with a positive leading coefficient. We then need to double this to allow for a
negative leading coefficient giving
2 × 80 = 160
choices in total which is the answer we report.

We can write

q
where p and q are coprime positive integers. What is the remainder whenp + q is divided by99991?
Answer: 8687
Solution: In our solution to this problem, we include an extended commentary at the end that
explainshowwedesignproblemstoeffectivelyevaluateamodel’smathematicalunderstandingwithin
the constraints of an answer-only competition.
Let N be n-Norwegian forn odd and write the three divisors ofN as
n = N
p + N
q + N
r where 1 ≤ p < q < rand p, q, r| N.
Minimising N is equivalent to maximising1
p + 1
q + 1
r subject to the resulting equation having an
integer solution forN with p, q, r| N. We will provide a classification of the minimalN for all n
odd.
We first consider the case whenp = 1 and q = 2. We consider the possibilities forr based on whether
it is odd and, in the even case, its remainder mod4.
N = n · 2(2s + 1)
6s + 5 (r = 2s + 1)
N = n · 4s
6s + 1 (r = 4s)
N = n · 2s + 1
3s + 2 (r = 4s + 2)
Note in the last case, we haveN odd (since n and 2s + 1 are odd) soq = 2 ∤ N meaning this will
not give an integer solution forN.
In the first two cases, the fraction is written in lowest terms so the denominator must dividen.
Provided this is satisfied, we haveq, r| N so this will yield a validN.
Thus, ifd1 and d5 are the smallest divisors ofn that are≥ 6 and are1 and 5 mod 6, respectively
then we have two candidates for minimalN from choosingd1 = 6s+ 1 or d5 = 6s+ 5 (since we want
to minimiser which is equivalent to minimisings). These give the following values forN:
2
3 · d1 − 1
d1
· n or 2
3 · d5 − 2
d5
· n. (▲)
Now we turn our attention to the casep = 1 and q = 3. Working through the small cases:
24

===== PAGE 25/28 =====
• r = 4 gives N = 12n
19 which forces19 | n. We get the same answer then by takingp = 1, q = 2,
and r = 12 so this is already covered by the first case.
• r = 5 gives N = 15n
23 which forces23 | n. We get a smallerN = 14n
23 by takingp = 1, q = 2,
and r = 7 so this is already covered by the first case.
• r = 6 gives N = 2n
3 . For the divisibility conditionq, r| N to be satisfied, we require9 | n.
• If r ≥ 7, then we have
N = n · 3r
4r + 3 = n

31 > 2n

Putting the cases forq = 2 together with the case forq = 3 and r = 6, we have shown that ifn has
a divisor≥ 6 that is±1 mod 6 or if9 | n then we can find ann-Norwegian integer≤ 2n
3 . For this
not to be the case, the only possibilities for prime factors of oddn are 3 and 5 and these must each
occur with multiplicity1 (otherwise we could use52 ≡ 1 mod 6). Thus, the only oddn ≥ 6 that
doesn’t satisfy this condition isn = 15 and we can manually check that the minimum15-Norwegian
integer is12 (12 + 2 + 1 = 15).
In all other cases, we claim one of the cases we’ve covered is optimal. This is true because
• We have already covered the cases forp = 1, q ∈ {2, 3} that giveN ≤ 2n
3 .
• If p = 1, q ≥ 4 then 1
p + 1
q + 1
r < 1 + 1
4 + 1
5 < 3
2 so N >2n
3 .
• If p ≥ 2 then 1
p + 1
q + 1
r ≤ 1
2 + 1
3 + 1
4 < 3
2 so N >2n
3 .
Define d1 and d5 to be equal to∞ if no such divisors ofn exist. Taking the optimal cases from what
we have considered above, we can write
f(n) =

otherwise
where we have used that if9 ∤ n and n ̸= 15, thenn has at least one factor that is±1 mod 6 by a
similar argument to the one used above.
We can further simplify this. If we definep1 and p5 to be the smallest prime divisors ofn that are
≥ 7 and are1 and 5 mod 6, respectively (and setpi = ∞ if these don’t exist) then
f(n) =



12 if n = 15

(■)
The bounds in the third case come from considering first whend1 = 25. This will occur if and only
if p1 > 25 which is the same asp1 ≥ 31 (the first prime that is1 mod 6 and greater than25). In
this case, settingd1 = 25 in (▲) gives
N = 2
3 · d1 − 1
d1
· n = 2
3 · 25 − 1
25 · n = 16
25 · n.
25

===== PAGE 26/28 =====
We then consider whend5 could give a smaller value ofN in (▲) which requires
2
3 · d5 − 2
d5
< 16
25 ⇐⇒ d5 < 50.
This will happen if and only ifp5 < 50 (noting that125 > 50 so we cannot get a suitabled5 from
powers of5). Thus, forN = 16n/25 to be optimal, we requirep5 ≥ 50 which is equivalent top5 ≥ 53
as that is the smallest prime that is5 mod 6 and greater than or equal to50.
When setting this question, we want to test that the models can produce a correct answer across a
wide range of cases. This reduces the risk of a model simply getting the correct answer via crude
pattern spotting from small values ofn.
From the classification in (■), there are at least six cases that we would want to test:
(i) n = 3α for α ≥ 2;
(ii) n = 5 · 3α for α ≥ 3 (there is little value in testing n = 15 since this falls to a direct
computation);
(iii) n = 25k where k has only ‘large’ prime divisors (so the third case holds);
(iv) Case where25 | n but n is also divisible by a smaller prime so we move into the fourth case;
(v) Case where the minimum is the first term in the fourth case;
(vi) Case where the minimum is the second term in the fourth case (and we can create further
challenge by choosing an example wherep5 > p1).
For cases(iii) to (vi), we may be tempted to use factorials to ensure no small prime divisors eg ask
for f(2025! + 125). However, this suffers from the issue that this is also equal tof(125) so a model
could stumble on the correct answer by simply omitting the factorial term. Instead, we appeal to
modular arithmetic starting withM = 3 2025! which, by the Fermat–Euler Theorem, hasM ≡ 1
(mod k) for k ≤ 2025 with gcd(k, 3) = 1 since φ(k) ≤ 2025 and henceφ(k) | 2025!.
Thus, for a positive integerc and positive integerk ≤ 2025 with gcd(k, 3) = 1, we have
k | M + c ⇐⇒ k | 1 + c.
Also, since3 | M and 3 ∤ c, 3 ∤ M + c. The factors ofM + c that are≤ 2025 will therefore be the
same as the factors of1 +c. This allows us to calculate the ‘small’ factors ofn = M + c even though
M is very large which in turn allows us to determine which case we fall into in (■).
Now we selectn to cover each of the cases described above:
(i) n = M — f(n) = 2n/3;
(ii) n = 5M — f(n) = 2n/3;
(iii) n = M + 1848374 (1 + 1848374 = 32 · 53 · 31 · 53) —f(n) = 16n/25;
(iv) n = M + 10162574 (1 + 10162574 = 32 · 52 · 312 · 47) —f(n) = (2/3)(45/47)n;
(v) n = M + 265710644 (1 + 265710644 = 33 · 5 · 97 · 103 · 197) —f(n) = (2/3)(96/97)n;
197 − 2
197 = 195
197 > 96
97 = 97 − 1
97 .
26

===== PAGE 27/28 =====
(vi) n = M + 44636594 (1 + 44636594 = 3· 5 · 103 · 167 · 173) —f(n) = (2/3)(165/167)n.
167 − 2
167 = 165
167 < 102
103 = 103 − 1
103 .
All models are allowed access to a calculator (and much more) which makes the factorisations
straightforward (this would still be possible for a human given the modest prime factors but this
would be somewhat arduous). We choose to keep the numbers large so even if the model has the idea
of replacingM with 1, the cases are still challenging to compute directly.
In cases(iii) to (vi), the expressions are of the formf(M + c) = (s/t)(M + c) for positive integers
s and t. Noting thatM ≫ c, M ≫ 2025! and t | 2025! we have

Remark1: ThisproblemwasadaptedfromProblemN1ofthe International Mathematical Olympiad
(IMO) Shortlist 2022which can be found here. The original version simply asked forf(2022).
All problems used in AIMO3 are entirely original; this adaptation is included solely to illustrate
the process behind designing a challenging problem within the answer-only format. We reserve our
original hard problems for the public and private Kaggle leaderboards, given the significant effort
involved in creating them. The original problem itself is unsuitable for an answer-only setting, as
it can be solved directly by enumerating possible positive integers and their divisor sums, leading
straightforwardly to the correct answer of1344.
Remark 2: Careful examination of the official solution provided in the shortlist reveals that it
ultimately depends on expressing2022 as 6(6k + 1), where6k + 1 is prime. The answer is then24k
(with 24k + 12k + 6 = 6(6 k + 1)). Motivated by this, a simpler reformulation that removes any
straightforward computational path is:
Problem: p = 2 ·330 + 1 is prime. A positive integer is called Norwegian if it has three distinct
positive divisors whose sum is equal to6p. Let N be the smallest Norwegian positive integer.
What is the remainder whenN is divided by99991?
Answer: 15245
However, this version tests only a single family of values forf(n). A model might still conjecture a
pattern by examining smaller primes, though this is complicated by the differing answers depending
on whetherp ≡ ±1 mod 6. The final version of the problem in the reference set generalises across
a broader range of cases, making it extremely difficult to identify a solution pattern even from
extensive numerical experimentation.
